==FAQ:
*Why isn't Sniper Mode working?
Open the Top Shot Sniper and see if the "Sniper Mode" checkbox is checked. If not, turn it on and click "Save".
Refresh the page after making the changes to the settings to see if the issue is resolved.

*How do I know this isn't a virus?
The code is open source and I have submitted this to Google for approval on the official chrome extension store. While waiting for the approval process, I have decided to allow anyone who wants to use this extension now to download it directly here.

*Can you add additional features?
Yes this is just the first version, I would consider it a beta. If you have recommendations, contact @spencer on NBA Top Shot Discord.
